ATTACHMENT A ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS

To the extent used in the Order Forms pursuant to this Agreement, the 
following definitions have the following meanings:

"Active (Production) License" means a license for Use of the Product in a 
production environment.  An Active/Active  configuration refers to a shared 
cluster configuration whereby applications and data are simultaneously 
available to all server Instances in the cluster. Consequently, 
Active/Active clusters support high availability ; 
"Computer" means one or a group of physical hardware machines processing 
data and hosting the running of one or more operating systems as defined in 
the Order Form;
"Core" means the main part of CPU that interprets the instructions and 
performs the binary calculations. Every CPU has at least one Core, but can 
be composed of several Cores; 
"CPU" (Central Processing Unit) means a functional unit in a computer that 
interprets and executes instructions. A CPU may contain multiple Cores with 
a Computer system or server. If the right of Use is based on CPUs and if 
the Licensed Component is used on a single computer with multiple CPUs, the 
CPU license must correspond with the number of respective Cores contained 
within such Computer. For example, a server that uses one dual-Core CPU 
requires two CPU licenses, and a server that uses four dual-Core CPUs 
requires eight CPU licenses;
"Instance" means a single occurrence of a Licensed Component. For 
clarification, if Customer has purchased only one Active Production 
Instance, Customer may run a single occurrence of the Licensed Component in 
RAM (Random Access Memory); "Named User" means a physical person 
susceptible to establish a session with the Licensed Component; 
"Node" means a running instance of a Axway program, i.e. a JVM (Java 
Virtual Machine) running an Axway application; 
"Partition" means a reserved part of the resources of an Operating 
Environment that is set aside for a specific purpose; Such as:
   - "Capped-Partition" means the Sub-Capacity Partition using a determined 
   maximum subset of the resources of an Operating Environment.
   - "Floating Partition" means the Sub-Capacity Partition using a 
   dynamically allocated subset of the resources of an Operating 
   Environment. The maximum potential of resources used by a Sub- Capacity 
   Partition equals the overall resources of the Operating Environment;
   - "Full-Capacity Partition" means a Partition using all the resources of 
   an Operating Environment. There can only be one "Full- Capacity 
   Partition" per Operating Environment. If there is another partition, 
   then both Partitions are "Sub-Capacity Partitions"; 
   - "Sub- Capacity Partition" means a partition using a subset of the 
   resources of an Operating Environment; 
"Passive (Non-Production) License" refers to a cluster fail over or 
disaster recovery software architecture. The passive software doesn't 
execute unless the licensed production copy of the Licensed Component 
fails. Where Customer is not able to use its licensed production copy of 
the Licensed Component in the event of fail over, the Passive license will 
start executing after a service interruption. A Passive License may also 
include those for test, development, archiving or quality control/quality 
assurance; 
"User" means, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order: (a) with 
respect to all Products other than Products that are part of Axway's 
Validation Authority or SecureTransport product suites, any person who is 
assigned login or Use rights or credentials  by Customer to access the 
applicable Product, whether directly, through another application or 
otherwise; (b) with respect to any Product included in Axway's 
SecureTransport product suite, any person or system who is assigned login 
or Use rights or credentials  by Customer to access the applicable Product, 
whether directly, through another application or otherwise; and (c) with 
respect to any Product included in Axway's Validation Authority product 
suite, any Validation Authority User. 
"Validation Authority User" means any Human User, Group User or Non-Human 
User.
   - "Human User" means, with respect to the applicable Product included in 
   Axway's Validation Authority product line, any human who has one or more 
   associated digital certificates associated with such human that: (i) 
   uniquely identify such human; and (ii) are contained in a database or 
   other repository that can be queried through Customer's implementation 
   of such Product.
   - "Group User" means, with respect to the applicable Product included in 
   Axway's Validation Authority product line, any group of humans that has 
   one or more associated digital certificates that: (i) uniquely identify 
   such group; and (ii) are contained in a database or other repository 
   that can be queried through Customer's implementation of such Product.
   - "Non-Human User" means, with respect to the applicable Product 
   included in Axway's Validation Authority product line, anything other 
   than a Human User or Group User (such as a device) ("Non-Human") that 
   has one or more associated digital certificates that: (i) uniquely 
   identify such Non-Human; and (ii) are contained in a database or other 
   repository that can be queried through Customer's implementation of such 
   Product.
